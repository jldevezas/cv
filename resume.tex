\emph{Graph-Based Entity-Oriented Search}\\[.5ex]
Thesis statement:\\
A graph-based joint representation of unstructured and structured data has the potential to unlock novel ranking strategies, that are, in turn, able to support the generalization of entity-oriented search tasks and to improve overall retrieval effectiveness by incorporating explicit and implicit information derived from the relations between text found in corpora and entities found in knowledge bases.\\[-.75em]

During the course of this doctoral work, two main systems were developed: ANT, an entity-oriented search engine for the University of Porto (prototype); and Army ANT, a workbench for innovation in entity-oriented search.\\[-.75em]

This thesis explored the blogosphere as an ecosystem of blogs comprised not only of a set of posts and their
individual content, but also of the interactions established through the hyperlinks connecting the posts. Based on
this study, we discovered a correlation between the blog's centrality and the length and number of posts.\\[.5ex]

\section{selected projects}

Here I present some of the most representative projects of my research career, where I developed multiple competences in the broad areas of information retrieval, network science and machine learning. This serves the purpose of illustrating not only the challenges I tackled, but also the feasibility, from start to finish, of all the projects I participated in, where a working prototype was always delivered, as a live demonstration of the carried research.\\

\begin{entrylist}

{2017--2021}
{Army ANT}
{Laboratório de Sistemas de Informação/U.Porto}
{Army ANT is an information retrieval research framework that supports experimentation with classical approaches, while also providing a high-level abstraction that motivates the implementation of innovative approaches in a shared evaluation environment. It facilitates the use of combined data, and it provides an environment for testing and evaluating multiple retrieval tasks, supporting keyword or entity queries, as well as documents, entities, or even terms, as the rankable results.\\

This software contains the majority of the code I developed throughout my PhD, providing iterators for well-known test collection, as well as evaluators for several common retrieval tasks from the TREC and INEX evaluation forums. Several experimental search models are also available in Army ANT, along with classical approaches based on Apache Lucene.\\

The code is available at \url{https://github.com/feup-infolab/army-ant}, and several Docker images are also available at \url{https://hub.docker.com/r/jldevezas/army-ant}, which can be installed using Docker Compose based on the code at \url{https://github.com/feup-infolab/army-ant-install}.\\

{ANT}
{Laboratório de Sistemas de Informação/U.Porto}
{ANT is an entity-oriented search engine available at \url{http://ant.fe.up.pt}, that indexes data from the SIGARRA Information System. On one side, it aims at improving search in U.Porto. On the other side, it aims at providing a platform to educate students and to support future research in the area.\\

This research project motivated my doctoral proposal, providing the ideal platform for the integration of previous areas of interest, particularly information retrieval and network science, but also recommendation and personalization. Working in ANT led me to identify several challenges in the area of entity-oriented search and to devise an innovative and focused contribution.\\

In a similar fashion to Google and other modern search engines, this enabled our system to answer user questions more directly, well beyond the traditional keyword-based matching. Our proposed integrated solution for segmentation and annotation of queries is illustrated in the following figure of the development front-end.\\

{Juggle}
{Laboratório SAPO/U.Porto}
{Juggle project aimed at improving music discovery based on a hybrid large-scale recommender system, capable of handling and combining different types of data, namely text and audio content, context from elements such as tags or location, and collaborative information from user profiles.\\

We tackled the challenges of multimodality and large-scale by developing a graph-based recommender system, supported on Neo4j, a popular and robust graph database that facilitated the modeling of content, context and collaborative information as nodes and edges in a graph. One of the biggest challenges was the translation of audio content to relationships in a graph, specifically the comparison of the audio features of a million songs with each other, which we solved by using an approximate search algorithm from image retrieval.}
\end{entrylist}

\begin{entrylist}
\entry{}{}{}{
Our recommendation algorithm was mainly supported on neighborhood methods for collaborative filtering, but we also used metrics from text retrieval to boost the relevance of tags in the long tail, while not completely disregarding tag popularity, in order to offer a playlist that better potentiated the discovery of music.\\

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{juggle.png}\\

In Juggle Mobile we presented the users with the ability to create an account and fill their taste profiles either based on our random artist rating system, or by importing their existing music information from Facebook or Last.fm. All the data from these different sources was mixed together based on our weighting model and used to provide recommendations to the user or to a group of nearby users.\\

Our experiments were based on a linear algebra approach, where, instead of a graph, we used a user-items matrix, applying singular value decomposition to build a latent factor model that provided the support for individual and group recommendations. For groups, we proposed a rating aggregation method that ensured an equal chance for every group member to have a relevant influence in the recommendations outcome.}

{Breadcrumbs}
{CRACS/INESC TEC}
{As a Breadcrumbs researcher, I was able to make contributions on several different areas. I implemented a language-independent named entity recognition system based on DBpedia entity lists. This system enabled the identification of three different types of entities — people, places and dates — tied to three of the five dimensions (the Five-Ws) of journalism: who, where and when. Using this data, a multidimensional entity coreference network was built, connecting news clips that cited the same entity. Next, I implemented the community detection methodologies for multidimensional networks proposed by Tang~et~al. This included the dimension integration strategies proposed by the authors, based on their unified view of four traditional community detection methodologies. These algorithms were also implemented in the system, along with the Louvain method, one of the state of the art algorithms for community detection.\\

Next, two visualization tools were developed to display and explore the acquired data. The first was analogous to a map, where communities were visualized as countries resulting of the aggregation of a node population. The second enabled the exploration of the multidimensional network based on the three identified dimensions: who, where and when. Some simple chart visualizations were created to display statistics about the top user and system tags and entities.\\

We used a topic model, based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to suggest titles for each collection of news clips; a simplistic event detection system was also created, in order to find relevant peaks of activity in a time series of entity frequencies. Some other trivial systems, such as an administration panel, capable of scheduling tasks, and a widget dashboard were also implemented.}
\end{entrylist}

\begin{entrylist}
\entry{}{}{}{
These algorithms were all developed using a web services architecture, communicating using either XML or JSON. Several scientific papers were published as the results of the described research. Below are some screenshots of the Breadcrumbs modules I contributed to in some way.\\

Among other widgets, we developed two main visualizations: a real time bar chart that displayed the number of visits per second along with a table showing traffic origin and destination; and a custom flow tree to visualize and quantify aggregated traffic sources for a given blog.\\
